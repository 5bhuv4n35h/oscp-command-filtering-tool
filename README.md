# oscp_checklist
**Features** 
- easily filter for commands based on tool, language, intent, port or operating system
- automatically updates both kali and victim ip address so you dont have to manually modify the command
- the filters are easily modifiable and content can be appended/deleted or you can start from fresh 

**Usage** 
- Replace all IP (kali_ip) -> To replace all instances of your existing kali ip with new kali ip, enter new ip address into "New Kali IP" and press replace (whenever you get new vpn ip)
- Replace all IP (victim_ip) -> To replace all instances of your victim ip with new victim ip, enter new ip address into "New Victim IP" and press replace (whenever you attack new box)
- Show / Hide / Clear Filter -> toggle the filters on / off
- Copy to clipboard -> copies the cell value into your clipboard (for those lazy to ctrl + c)

**Disclaimer**

- I shared this with a friend and some vba functions dont seem to work for him (it works fine for me) - I suspect its due to 
excel versioning issues and not the vba code itself as it doesnt reference any files/folders external to the excel
- If enough people have the same problem, I may try to find the root cause and debug, else I wont
- These arent my notes, more of a checklist that I used for convenience
